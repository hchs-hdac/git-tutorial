# Getting Started:

Before you start this tutorial, you should have some basic knowledge of HTML,the core structure of every webpage:
Visit https://www.york.ac.uk/teaching/cws/wws/webpage1.html to read about the basics, and read about classes and ids here: https://www.codecademy.com/articles/classes-vs-ids.

The most important takeaways here for the purposes of this tutorial are familiarity with basic elements of a page (head, body, h1, p, div) and with classes and ids.

## HTML Element Inspector
The element inspector in your web browser (right click, then hit inspect) allows you to see all the HTML on the webpage you are currently visiting! This way you can find which class and id names the page uses (this will be relevant later).

## BeautifulSoup
BeautifulSoup is a library in Python that parses through HTML, allowing you to extract single elements or groups of elements from a webpage. You'll learn in the following tutorials how you can extract elements from the web!

In this tutorial we'll also be taking advantage of another Python library, Requests, which returns the components of a webpage when fed a URL. 

## Installing Packages
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands in your terminal/command prompt:

pip install bs4
pip install requests
